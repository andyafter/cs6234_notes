Linear Regression method is applicable only if nonlinear function is
linear in terms of function parameters:
$$\dis f(x; a) = \sum_{k=1}^m a_kh_k(x)$$

Many nonlinear functions are not like that, for example:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
f_1(x) & = \frac{x^2}{a_1 + (x - a_2)}\\
f_2(x, y, z) & = \frac{x^2}{a_1 + x^2} + \frac{y^2}{a_2 + y^2} + \frac{z^2}{a_3 + z^2}
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}

\frametitle{Condition Number}
\begin{itemize}
\item The condition number of C gives a measure of its anisotropy or
  eccentricity.
\item If the condition number of a set C is small (say, near one) it
  means that the set has approximately the same width in all
  directions, i.e., it is nearly spherical.
\item If the condition number is large, it means that the set is far
  wider in some directions than in others.
\item $cond(f) = \frac{\lambda_{max}(f)}{\lambda_{min}(f)}$
\item $\lambda_{max}$ and $\lambda_{min}$ describes minimum and maximum eigenvalues in 2D.
\end{itemize}
